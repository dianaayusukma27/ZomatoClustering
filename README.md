# ZomatoClustering
These projects were made to complete the “Introduction to Data Science” course at my  fifth semester. In the first project, I use the algorithmic model of K-Means Clustering, K-Modes Clustering, and Agglomerative clustering algorithms to cluster zomato data based on the quality of its service.
